### Homework 3

To run this program, navigate to src>com.Homework3>Homework3.java and
run the main function. It will prompt you to enter a numerical value, either 1
for Breadth-First Search or 2 for Depth-First Search, and then a starting node.
The way I have the project structured, you should not need to make
any imports. If that isn't the case, they've been included regardless.

The main driver creates an ArrayList based on the one provided in the assignment
using the Graph class, which it then passes alongside the start note
to either the BreadthFirstSearch or DepthFirstSearch classes,
which print the nodes they visit in order.
